# gRPC

**gRPC** is a modern **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** framework developed by Google. It's not a transport protocol like TCP or UDP ‚Äî it‚Äôs a high-level system that helps services talk to each other using HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers.

## üöÄ What Makes gRPC Special?

- **Built on HTTP/2** ‚Üí So it gets multiplexing, streaming, and binary framing out of the box.
- **Uses Protocol Buffers** ‚Üí Compact, fast, and strongly typed data format.
- **Defines services, not routes** ‚Üí You call functions, not URLs.
- **Supports streaming** ‚Üí Bi-directional streams like a chat or live feed.
- **Cross-language** ‚Üí Works in C++, Go, Java, Python, Node.js, Rust, etc.

## üß† How gRPC Works

1. Define services and messages in a `.proto` file.
2. Generate client/server code using `protoc`.
3. Client calls functions like `sayHello()` as if they were local.
4. Data is serialized with Protobuf and sent over HTTP/2.
5. Server decodes the message and executes the function.

## üì¶ Protocol Stack

```txt
App Layer (gRPC) -> HTTP/2 (Transport) ->  TCP (Reliable Delivery) -> IP (Routing) -> Network (Ethernet/Wi-Fi/etc.)
```

Your data ‚Üí Protobuf serializer ‚Üí compact binary ‚Üí send/store binary ‚Üí Protobuf deserializer ‚Üí original structured object

## üîÑ Data Flow

```txt
Client Calls: sayHello(name: "Tahsin")
    ‚Üì
Encodes using Protobuf (Your data ‚Üí Protobuf serializer ‚Üí compact binary)
    ‚Üì
Sends binary via HTTP/2 stream
    ‚Üì
Server receives, decodes (Protobuf deserializer), calls the actual function
    ‚Üì
Response encoded & sent back via HTTP/2
    ‚Üì
Client receives result like a normal function return
```

## üí¨ RPC Types in gRPC

| Type                     | Description                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Unary RPC                | One request ‚Üí One response        |
| Server streaming         | One request ‚Üí Stream of responses |
| Client streaming         | Stream of requests ‚Üí One response |
| Bi-directional streaming | Both sides stream simultaneously  |

## üß™ Real Use Cases

| Use Case          | Why gRPC?                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Microservices     | Strong typing, fast binary format            |
| Mobile-backend    | Efficient communication over mobile networks |
| Real-time systems | Bidirectional streaming via HTTP/2           |
| Polyglot systems  | Language-agnostic client/server generation   |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Caveats of gRPC

- Browsers don‚Äôt fully support native gRPC ‚Äî use gRPC-Web + a proxy.

- You‚Äôll need to install the protoc compiler and gRPC libraries for your language.

- Debugging is trickier than plain HTTP (binary, not human-readable).

- Protobuf ‚â† JSON ‚Äî it‚Äôs faster but not self-describing.

### üì¶ What is Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)?

Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a language-agnostic, efficient, and extensible binary serialization format developed by Google. It‚Äôs used to encode structured data ‚Äî like JSON or XML ‚Äî but in a much smaller, faster, and strongly-typed way.

Think of it like: JSON, but: Smaller, Faster, Type-safe, Not human-readable

üí° Why use Protobuf?

- **Compact** ‚Üí Binary format takes less space than JSON

- **Fast** ‚Üí Parsing is quicker than text-based formats

- **Cross-language** ‚Üí Supports many languages (Node.js, Go, Python, Java, etc.)

- **Schema-driven** ‚Üí Defines data with .proto files

- **Forward/backward compatible** ‚Üí Easy to evolve over time

> üß† gRPC requires Protobuf to define the service methods and messages it uses. It‚Äôs the default and only serialization format supported in gRPC (though some workarounds exist for JSON).

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Unary RPC Example

1. run server

```bash
 npx ts-node ./gRPC/server.ts
```

2. run client

```bash
npx ts-node ./gRPC/client.ts
```

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Bi-directional streaming Example

1. run server

```bash
 npx ts-node ./gRPC/chat-server.ts
```

2. run client

```bash
npx ts-node ./gRPC/chat-client.ts
```
