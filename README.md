# protocols

This project demonstrates various internet communication protocols through minimal, example-based implementations.

The project aims to be a practical learning resource for understanding these protocols deeply.

The focus is on clearly illustrating the core concepts, behavior, and practical usage of each protocol â€” without abstraction or frameworks.
